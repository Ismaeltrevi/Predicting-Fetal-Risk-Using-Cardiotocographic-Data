# Predicting Fetal Risk Using Cardiotocographic Data

**Authors**: Jacob Heyman, Ismael Araujo

## Overview
- Reducing fetal mortality a major goal of Medical Science
- Many fetal deaths are preventable and are the result of low available resources.
- Cardiotocograms are cheap and accesable solution for monitering fetal health. 
- CTGs provide data on fetal heart rate, fetal movements, uteraine contractions and more.
- These metrics can be used to predict the fetal health and prevent child mortality


## Business Problem
Preventing Child mortality is a key indicator of medical progress.  A large precentage of deaths are the result of low access to resources that moniter fetal health.  One cost effective solution to moniter fetal health is the use of Cardiotocograms(CTGs). CTGs moniter fetal heart rate, fetal movement, uterine contractions, suddon heart rate changes and many other health metrics.  Using Data collected from a CTG, can we predict fetal health, and catagorize the state of fetal health into three classes (normal,suspect and pathological).
